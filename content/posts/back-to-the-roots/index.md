I haven't been writing blog posts for someting like... at least 10 years!<br>
<br>
I used to have this little hand-crafted blog, back in University, where I was logging all my coding adventures and hacker culture dilemmas.<br>
I used to love just blogging and hanging in that little virtual space of mine - I used to call it my **lair**.<br>
<br>
Back in the days I was your classic Unix guy (daily driving FreeBSD like a madman) coding mostly in C and shell scripting and doing lots of web dev in PHP.<br>
Many things have changed in those years and I have become a much more flexible person, even if at heart I'm still a Unix guy.<br>
<br>
After a long absence in which I mostly stayed around Macs and Windows boxes, I'm going back to *nix systems - this time I'm skipping BSD and choosing Linux for some peace of mind. In this process, I'm also trying to reduce my usage of corporation-owned services as much as humanly possible. I won't be able to go completely free software / open source, especially because of my job in game development, but I will try to find alternatives when I can.<br>
<br>
The reason for this change is that I'm getting increasingly more tired of feeling in a golden (actually bronze, these days) cage where nothing really belongs to me and I have to accept tons of spywares and other bloatware such as AI that I don't need or want, ads in the start menu (this one is crazy) and microphones that spy my conversations to sell me products I don't need.<br> 
<br>
Returning to the Unix world brought back my hunger for coding and exploring and thinkering... and so here I am, blogging once again!<br>
Expect some random opinions and dev logs.<br>
<br>
Stay tuned! :)
